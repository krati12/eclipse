Hibernate Api
1)Create a Session factory - create by hibernate.cfg.xml
2)create a seesion from session factory
3)Use the seesion to save model Objects

1)if mark field as static or transiet then database will not create column for that
because it is going to same for whole table

-> @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE) will save field as date
-> @Lob - if you have huge amount data or bytestream it autmatically choose Clob or blob

userId is purpose of primary key and have business use then its natural key
userid is purpose of primary key but dont have any business use then its surrogate key

@GeneratedValue will act as surrogate key and hibernate will generate unique value for you
 as per its data type define
 
 @value is value object it give value to their object like address give value to user.
 @entity which have its meaning of its own 
 
 @EmbeddedId will make object as primary key
